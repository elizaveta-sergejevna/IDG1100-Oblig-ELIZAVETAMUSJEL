1. What components are part of the Von Neuman Architecture

- The Von Neuman Architecture consists of five main components: A Central Prosessing Unit, a Control Unit, a Memory Unit, 
Input and Output mechanisms and External Mass Storage.

2. What is user space?

- The user space is one of the components of an operating system (OS). In an OS, there is a separation between user space and kernel space where 
user space is the memory area allocated to running applications. Plug-ins and required libraries are loaded into the user space as well. 
When a document is opened and edited, that file will also be temporarily loaded into the user space. The user space contains the various programs 
that the OS needs to interact with the kernel space.

3. What is the shell?

- The shell is a computer program that opens up an operating system’s services to a user or a program. The shell comes in two forms: 
Command-line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI). The CLI requires the user to be familiar with specific commands and their 
calling syntax. The GUI is considered as being easier to use and is based on graphics which provides for opening, closing, moving and resizing 
different windows.

4. Where is the shell located?

- The shell is characterized as an application and therefore lives in the user space of an operating system.

5. What is the main task of the shell?

- The main task of the shell is to manage the interaction between the user and the machine by recieving inputs from the user, interpreting that 
input and then giving an output from the underlying operating system. The shell runs the user’s commands, programs and scripts. 
It can be used to manipulate data and executing several applications under certain conditions. 
In short: The shell is responsible for the execution of all programs that the user requests from their terminal.
