        <div class="text">
        <p><span>Answer to question 1:</span> The Von Neuman Architecture consists of five main components: 
            A Central Prosessing Unit, a Control Unit, a Memory Unit, Input and Output mechanisms 
            and External Mass Storage.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 2:</span> The user space is one of the components of an operating system (OS). 
            In an OS, there is a separation between user space and kernel space where user space is the 
            memory area allocated to running applications. Plug-ins and required libraries are loaded into the 
            user space as well. When a document is opened and edited, that file will also be temporarily loaded 
            into the user space. The user space contains the various programs that the OS needs to interact 
            with the kernel space.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 3:</span> The shell is a computer program that opens up an operating system’s services to a 
            user or a program. The shell comes in two forms: Command-line interface (CLI) and graphical user 
            interface (GUI). The CLI requires the user to be familiar with specific commands and their calling 
            syntax. The GUI is considered as being easier to use and is based on graphics which provides for 
            opening, closing, moving and resizing different windows.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 4:</span> The shell is characterized as an application and therefore lives in the user space 
            of an operating system.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 5:</span> The main task of the shell is to manage the interaction between the user and 
            the machine by recieving inputs from the user, interpreting that input and then giving an output from 
            the underlying operating system. The shell runs the user’s commands, programs and scripts. 
            It can be used to manipulate data and executing several applications under certain conditions. 
            In short: The shell is responsible for the execution of all programs that the user requests from 
            their terminal.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 6:</span> The octal representation of a file that can be read and written only by its 
            owner is 6 0 0.</p>     
        <p><span>Answer to question 7:</span> The name of the special user who can access and modify every file in UNIX-systems 
            is root administrator. (Or just root, administrator, admin, supervisor or superuser?)</p> 
        <p><span>Answer to question 8:</span> In UNIX-systems there are three file permission classes available: 
            User, group and others. The user is usually the one who created a file and is the owner of that file. 
            The user can decide who else can get the permission to access and/or modify the file. 
            ‘Group’ is members of a group of users. ‘Others’ is everyone who are not the file owner or members of the group.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 9:</span> As of 2020, 71.8% of servers have UNIX-like OS.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 11:</span> Access the current working directory: <code>pwd</code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 12:</span> Rename files: <code>mv</code>. Example: <code>mv [file name] [new file name]</code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 13:</span> Schedule the execution of programs: <code>cron</code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 14:</span> Forcefully shut down the command with PID 123: <code>kill 123</code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 15:</span> Access your root user: <code>sudo -s</code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 16:</span> <code>30 * * * 0 echo "This is a cronjob scheduled to minute 30 on Sunday" >> /home/luckyliza/cronjobs/job1.txt</code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 17:</span> <code>30 * 15 * * echo "This is a cronjob scheduled to minute 30 on day-of-month 15" >> /home/luckyliza/cronjobs/job2.txt</code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 18:</span> <code>30 05 * 06 0-1 echo "This is a cronjob scheduled to 05:30 on every day-of-week from Sunday through Monday in June" >> /home/luckyliza/cronjobs/job3.txt</code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 19:</span> Open new script: <code>nano script19.sh</code>. 
            Create script: <code>#/bin/bash echo "My name is Liza and today's date is" $(date)</code>.
            Give execution rights to the script: <code>chmod -x script19.sh</code>. 
        Execute script: <code>./script19.sh My name is Liza and today's date is man. 16. nov 2020 16.50.34</code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 20:</span> Open, create and chmod new script: <code>#!/bin/bash read -p "Enter two numeric values:" no1 no2 echo "You have entered the values" $no1 "and" $no2</code>.
        Execution: <code>./script20.sh
            Enter two numeric values:65 43
            You have entered the values 65 and 43
            </code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 21:</span> Open, create and chmod new script: <code>#!/bin/bash read -p "Please state your username:" username echo $username "stored"</code>.
        Excecution: <code>./script21.sh
            Please state your username: SUPERKOOL_93
            SUPERKOOL_93 stored
            </code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 22:</span> I'm not sure if I've understood the task correctly, but this is what I did:
            Created the script: <code>#!/bin/bash hostname=$(hostname)
                echo "This script is running on $hostname"
                </code>.
            Executed it like so: <code>./script22.sh
                This script is running on LAPTOP-LQECTNR2
                </code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 23:</span> Open, create and chmod new script: <code>#!/bin/bash
            work_dir=$(pwd)
            echo "Your current working directory is $work_dir"
            </code>.
        Execution: <code>./script23.sh
            Your current working directory is /c/Users/Bruker/scripts
            </code>.</p>
        <p><span>Answer to question 24: Cronjob tutorial</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open Ubuntu and access root by typing <code>sudo -s</code>.</li>
            <li>Create a directory for your cronjob (optional) by typing <code>mkdir [name of directory]</code>.</li>
            <li>Access the new directory by using <code>cd</code>.</li>
            <li>Access the cronjob-making-window (I don’t know what it’s called properly!) by typing <code>crontab -e</code>.</li>
            <li>The cronjob has to be scheduled to every 30 minutes on today’s date and it has to print &quot;Task scheduled at&quot; + DATE.
                Start by scheduling the task. <a href="https://crontab.guru" target="_blank">crontab.guru</a> is a good tool for that if you get confused. 
                At the time of writing, the date is November 16th. 2020. The schedule for the cronjob is 
                <code>30 * 16 11 *</code>. (There is no year-option in standard crons).</li>
            <li>Type: <code>echo &quot;Task scheduled at $(date)&quot; >> [your directory navigation]/timecron.txt</code>. 
                The .txt is the file where you redirect the output of the cronjob. You can name this file whatever you want.</li>
            <li>Check the status of your new cronjob by typing <code>service cron status</code>.</li>
            <li>(If your cronjob is not running, type in <code>service cron start</code>).</li>
            <li>Execute the cronjob by typing <code>cat timecron.txt</code> (or whatever you called the .txt).</li>
            <li>The cronjob is now displaying!</li>
        </ol>

        <p><span>Answer to question 25:</span> This one was difficult! I'm not sure if I've understood
            the task correctly, but this is what I managed to do: This is the script:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>#!/bin/bash</code></li>
            <li><code>echo -n "> 1: What is the capital of Russia?</code></li>
            <li><code>> 2: Which band created the world famous classic Bohemian Rhapsody?</code></li>
            <li><code>> 3: Who wrote Pride and Prejudice?</code></li>
            <li><code>> Enter the corresponding number to get the answer: "</code></li>
            <li><code>read ANSWER</code></li>
            <li><code>case $ANSWER in</code></li>
            <li><code>1)</code></li>
            <li><code>echo -n "> The capital of Russia is Moscow"</code></li>
            <li><code>;;</code></li>
            <li><code>2)</code></li>
            <li><code>echo -n "> The band Queen, with its charismatic frontman Freddie Mercury, created the hit Bohemian Rhapsody"</code></li>
            <li><code>;;</code></li>
            <li><code>3)</code></li>
            <li><code>echo -n "> Well known author Jane Austen wrote the novel Pride and Prejudice"</code></li>
            <li><code>;;</code></li>
            <li><code>*)</code></li>
            <li><code>echo -n "> There is no answer to that!"</code></li>
            <li><code>;;</code></li>
            <li><code>esac</code></li>
        </ul>
            <p>This is what it looks like when executed and I've entered the number 3:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li><code>./questions2.sh</code></li>
                <li><code>> 1: What is the capital of Russia?</code></li>
                <li><code>> 2: Which band created the world famous classic Bohemian Rhapsody?</code></li>
                <li><code>> 3: Who wrote Pride and Prejudice?</code></li>
                <li><code>> Enter the corresponding number to get the answer: 3</code></li>
                <li><code>> Well known author Jane Austen wrote the novel Pride and Prejudice</code></li>
            </ul>
